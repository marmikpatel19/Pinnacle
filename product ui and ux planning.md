## Product

- User
  - Candidate (B2C)–primary user since this is for submitting basic apps
  - (for the future–not for this project: Companies hiring (B2B)--secondary users who seek to control jobs for their company)
- Branding & features
  - Let’s build something more luxurious, high-quality, high-end clients. This sounds different than recruitment platforms usually ⇒ fun, interesting.
  - Basic persona (candidate):
    - Sophia Chen, Staff Machine Learning Engineer, ex-Google Brain, now exploring leadership roles in AI startups.
    - Pain Points:
      - Gets spammed with irrelevant recruiter messages on LinkedIn.
      - Finds FAANG and startup job portals overwhelming—too many low-effort applications.
      - Doesn’t want to publicly announce job searching (privacy concerns).
      - Prefers selective, high-impact opportunities rather than mass-market hiring.
      - Wants white-glove treatment—a recruiter who understands her niche expertise.
  - Features based on brand
    - Pinnacle branding
